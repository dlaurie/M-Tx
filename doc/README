M-Tx Documentation Package
==========================

This is the development version of the M-Tx documentation.  It contains
all the sources for generating the Users's Manual (`mtxdoc.pdf`), its 
index (`mtxindex.pdf`), both together (`mtx.pdf`) and two sample music 
documents (`halleluja.pdf`, `kanons.pdf`). 

I'm assuming a fairly recent TeX installation that has Bob Tennent's driver 
programs `musixtex` and `m-tx`. TeXLive 2013 will do. If you install via 
`apt-get`, the `m-tx` package will install all the prerequisites too. 
'pdftk' will be used if available but you can get by without it.

Everything after the "Quick Start" section is outdated.

Quick Start
-----------

You probably got this code in one of two ways (`061` may be different):

    unzip -a mtxD061.zip

    git clone https://github.com/dlaurie/M-Tx

In either case, your working directory must be the one containing this 
file. If you have GNU make, issue the command

    make

Messages will flit by, hopefully ending in

    Output written on mtxindex.pdf (3 pages, 54045 bytes).
    Transcript written on mtxindex.log.

and a new copy of the file mtx.pdf will be available.

To make the examples, respectively do

    make halleluja
    make kanons

If you do not have GNU Make, execute the commands found at the top
of the Makefile by entering them in a command shell.

Using the Makefile instead
--------------------------

There is legacy code in the Makefile for making `dvi`, `ps`, or `lj`
options of the documentation files. This code does not require the 
aforementioned driver programs.

Via DVI files
-------------

You can make any of the four file formats. Type

  make dvitarget && make config

to configure the option.  Make sure that everything looked for was found.
You can then choose between:

  make	      Makes mtx.dvi (and mtxdoc.dvi, mtxindex.dvi on the way there)
  make all    Make .dvi files.  
  make ps     Make .dvi and .ps files
  make pdf    Make .dvi, .ps and .pdf files
  make ?.lj   Make the specified .lj file

Via PDF files
-------------

Type

    make pdftarget && make config

to configure the option.  Make sure that everything looked for was found.
You can then choose between:

---------   --------------------------------------------------------------
make	    Makes mtx.pdf (and mtxdoc.pdf, mtxindex.pdf on the way there)
make all    Make .pdf files.  
make ps     Make .pdf and .ps files
---------   --------------------------------------------------------------
 
You don't have the option of making .dvi or .lj files.

FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions
-------------------------------- 

1. I get "make: ./prepmx: Command not found".

   A: You have omitted the `make config` step.

2. I have configured, but the make still fails.

   A: Look at the screen output from `make config`.  Make sure that
      there is a file name after each `...`.

3. Is there any difference between the `.pdf` and `.ps` files made by the
   two options?

   A: Yes.  If you go by the second route, slurs tend to look smoother
      and certain additional slur shapes are possible; see the PMX manual.
      Also, the two versions look a little different on a low-resolution 
      monitor, but apart from slurs, should be virtually indistinguishable
      when printed.

4.  What are the prerequisites?

   A: You need to have MusiXTEX, PMX, musixlyr and M-Tx already installed.
      If all that does not give you Ghostscript, you can still build 
      everything except `mtx.pdf`.
